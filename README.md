# hello-world
My first repository on github, Don't know what i am expecting but i am open minded to learn.

My name is Tyll i am from germany and i love to accumulate knowledge especially about economics. Since a few weeks I am thinking about sharing my knowledge with other people which brought me to the point figuring out how. I think there are no two opinions that the www is the best way to do this. I started about one week ago to see the internet from an other angle of view, thats the reason i started using github because i want no longer to be just a user, i want to be doer and learn how to programm.
